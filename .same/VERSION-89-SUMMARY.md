# Version 89: Real-Time P&L Tracking for Open Orders

**Date:** December 12, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - CRITICAL FIX DEPLOYED
**Pattern:** Live P&L calculation based on market price movements

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL FIX - Commit b89051b

**Issue Found During Testing:**
- All orders (including LIMIT orders) were showing as FILLED immediately
- Orders appearing in "Order History" instead of "Open Orders"
- Real-time P&L tracking not working because orders weren't staying OPEN

**Root Cause:**
- `ordersAPI.createOrder()` in `/src/lib/api/orders.ts` was calling `/api/orders/execute`
- The `/execute` endpoint uses old logic that immediately fills ALL orders
- Should have been calling `/api/orders` endpoint (new logic)

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Changed endpoint from `/api/orders/execute` → `/api/orders`
- ✅ Updated parameter mapping to match new API
- ✅ LIMIT orders now stay OPEN as intended
- ✅ MARKET orders execute immediately as intended

**Commits:**
- `497c322` - Initial Version 89 (backend + frontend enhancements)
- `b89051b` - Critical fix for orders API endpoint

## 🎯 What's New in Version 89

### **Problem Fixed:**
1. ❌ **Old Behavior:** All orders were showing as "FILLED" immediately
2. ❌ **Old Behavior:** No way to see unrealized P&L for open positions
3. ❌ **Old Behavior:** Couldn't track live price movements vs entry price

### **New Behavior:**
1. ✅ **LIMIT orders stay OPEN** until market price reaches the limit
2. ✅ **MARKET orders execute immediately** and show as FILLED
3. ✅ **Real-time P&L calculation** for all LONG/SHORT positions
4. ✅ **Live price tracking** with visual indicators
5. ✅ **Leverage amplification** properly calculated

---

## 📊 Backend Changes

### **File: `/src/app/api/orders/route.ts`**

#### **Enhanced Order Creation:**
```typescript
// Initialize filled to 0 for all orders
filled: 0,

// All orders start as OPEN
status: 'OPEN',
```

#### **MARKET vs LIMIT Order Logic:**
- **MARKET Orders:** Execute immediately, status → FILLED
- **LIMIT Orders:** Stay OPEN, wait for price to reach limit
- **STOP_LIMIT Orders:** Stay OPEN, triggered when stop price is hit

#### **Detailed Logging:**
```
✅ Order created: uuid - LIMIT LONG 0.1 BTCUSDT @ 92000
🔒 Locked 9200 USDT for order uuid
⚡ Executing MARKET order uuid immediately...
✅ MARKET order uuid FILLED at 92415.50
📋 LIMIT order uuid placed - waiting for market price to reach 92000
```

## 🎨 Frontend Changes

### **File: `/src/app/futures/page.tsx`**

#### **Enhanced Orders Table Columns:**

| Old Columns | New Columns |
|------------|-------------|
| Price | **Entry Price** (Your order price) |
| Filled | **Mark Price** (Current market price) |
| - | **Unrealized P&L** (USD + %) |

#### **Real-Time P&L Calculation:**

**For LONG Positions:**
```typescript
const priceDiff = currentPrice - entryPrice;
unrealizedPnL = (priceDiff / entryPrice) * (amount * entryPrice) * leverage;
pnlPercent = (priceDiff / entryPrice) * 100 * leverage;
```

**For SHORT Positions:**
```typescript
const priceDiff = entryPrice - currentPrice;
unrealizedPnL = (priceDiff / entryPrice) * (amount * entryPrice) * leverage;
pnlPercent = (priceDiff / entryPrice) * 100 * leverage;
```

#### **Live Tracking Indicator:**
- **"LIVE" badge** shows on orders matching current trading pair
- **Real-time price updates** from WebSocket feed
- **Price movement arrows** (↑↓) show direction and amount

#### **Summary Footer:**
- **Total Open Orders:** Count of all OPEN orders
- **Total Position Value:** Sum of all order values
- **Total Unrealized P&L:** Aggregated P&L across all positions
- **Live Tracking:** X/Y orders being actively tracked

## 📱 UI/UX Improvements

### **Orders Table:**

#### **Before:**
```
Date | Pair | Type | Side | Price | Amount | Filled | Total | Action
```

#### **After:**
```
Date | Pair | Type | Side | Entry Price | Mark Price | Amount | Unrealized P&L | Total Value | Action
                                                          ↑ LIVE
```

### **Example Row:**
```
12/12 10:30 | BTCUSDT [LIVE] | LIMIT | LONG 20x | $92,000.00 | $92,500.00 ↑ $500 | 0.1 BTC | +$1,000 USD +10.87% | $9,200.00 | Cancel
```

### **Visual Indicators:**
- 🟢 **LIVE** badge = Order pair matches current chart
- ↑ **Green arrow** = Price moving up
- ↓ **Red arrow** = Price moving down
- 🟢 **Green P&L** = Profit
- 🔴 **Red P&L** = Loss

## 🔧 How It Works

### **Scenario 1: LONG Position Profit**

**User Action:**
1. Place LIMIT LONG order at $92,000 with 20x leverage
2. Order size: 0.1 BTC
3. Total value: $9,200

**Market Movement:**
- BTC price rises to $92,500

**System Calculation:**
- Entry Price: $92,000
- Mark Price: $92,500
- Price Difference: +$500 (+0.54%)
- Unrealized P&L: +$500 × 0.1 × 20 = **+$1,000 USD**
- ROE: +10.87%

**User Sees:**
```
Entry Price: $92,000.00
Mark Price:  $92,500.00 ↑ $500
Unrealized P&L: +$1,000.00 USD (+10.87%)
```

### **Scenario 2: SHORT Position Profit**

**User Action:**
1. Place LIMIT SHORT order at $92,500 with 10x leverage
2. Order size: 0.1 BTC
3. Total value: $9,250

**Market Movement:**
- BTC price drops to $92,000

**System Calculation:**
- Entry Price: $92,500
- Mark Price: $92,000
- Price Difference: -$500 (-0.54%)
- Unrealized P&L: +$500 × 0.1 × 10 = **+$500 USD**
- ROE: +5.41%

**User Sees:**
```
Entry Price: $92,500.00
Mark Price:  $92,000.00 ↓ $500
Unrealized P&L: +$500.00 USD (+5.41%)
```

## ✅ Testing Instructions

### **Test 1: Place LIMIT LONG Order**

**Steps:**
1. Go to `/futures`
2. Select BTC/USDT
3. Set order type to "Limit"
4. Set leverage to 20x
5. Enter price: Current price + $100
6. Enter size: 0.01 BTC
7. Click "Buy/Long BTC"
8. Confirm order
9. Go to "Open Orders" tab

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Order appears in Open Orders table
- ✅ Shows "LIVE" badge
- ✅ Entry Price = Your limit price
- ✅ Mark Price = Current market price
- ✅ Unrealized P&L shows negative (since market price < entry)
- ✅ As market price changes, P&L updates in real-time

---

### **Test 2: Watch Live P&L Updates**

**Steps:**
1. Have an open LIMIT LONG order (from Test 1)
2. Keep "Open Orders" tab open
3. Watch the BTC price change
4. Observe the "Mark Price" column
5. Observe the "Unrealized P&L" column

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Mark Price updates every ~1 second
- ✅ P&L recalculates with each price update
- ✅ Green numbers when price moves in your favor
- ✅ Red numbers when price moves against you
- ✅ Arrow indicators show price direction

### **Test 3: Multiple Orders Tracking**

**Steps:**
1. Place LIMIT LONG order on BTC/USDT
2. Switch to ETH/USDT
3. Place LIMIT SHORT order on ETH/USDT
4. Go back to "Open Orders" tab

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Both orders appear in table
- ✅ Only ETH order shows "LIVE" badge (current pair)
- ✅ BTC order uses static price (last known)
- ✅ ETH order shows real-time updates
- ✅ Summary shows total P&L across both

---

### **Test 4: Summary Footer Calculations**

**Steps:**
1. Have 2-3 open orders
2. Check Summary Footer
3. Verify calculations

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Total Open Orders = Count of OPEN orders
- ✅ Total Position Value = Sum of (amount × entry price)
- ✅ Total Unrealized P&L = Aggregate P&L
- ✅ Live Tracking shows X/Y format
- ✅ Colors update based on profit/loss
